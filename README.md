# Project: Flight Booker

This is another app exercise from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/building-advanced-forms) to build the first three steps of a typical, 
but simplified, process for booking a one-way flight:

A typical airline booking flow:

1. Enter desired departing and arrival airports, along with number 
   of passengers, and click “Search Flights”
2. Choose from a list of available flights
3. Enter information for each passenger, then "Confirm Reservation"
4. The flight and passenger information sumary will then be shown

The final step, billing information, isn't part of the project, 
but it would be done using something like Paypal, one of several billing
gems, or an API like Stripe, etc.

You'll also notice that styling is minimal, there are a few things done
to make it readable, but given that this is intended to be a back-end
exercise not front-end.

The point of the project is to make use of associations and some complex
forms to illustrate some of the elegance of Rails.

This project uses a lot of nonsensical flight information, don't think
very hard about it.
