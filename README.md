# Project: Flight Booker

In this project, we’ll build the first three steps of a typical 
checkout process for booking a one-way flight:

A typical airline booking flow:

1. Enter desired dates / airports and click “Search”
2. Choose from among a list of eligible flights
3. Enter passenger information for all passengers

The last step, billing information, isn't part of the project, 
but it would be done using something like Paypal, a billing gem, 
or an API like Stripe, etc.

This project won't be prepared for deployment.
